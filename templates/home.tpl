    <h1>PHP Tasks app</h1>
    <p>I wrote this web app in under 12 hours to test my skills with PHP, OOP, Dynamic Databases, Etc.</p>
    <p>If you want to see your tasks you must first sign up, or log in if you already have an account.</p>
    <p>You can add tasks, check your tasks, see detailed info on your tasks, etc. Just navigate to the page you want
        with the navigation bar on the top</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, contact me through my Linkedin, or Discord (preferably)!</p>
